Coding exercises from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera 

Exercise 1: Linear regression with gradient descent to optimize cost function. Feature normalization.

Exercise 2: Logistic regression with regularization, plus polynomial feature mapping to fit non-linear decision boundaries.

Exercise 3: Multi-class (one vs. all) classification of MNIST data using regularized logistic regression. Also implements feedforward neural network/multilayer perceptron (MLP) for MNIST classification with pre-trained weights.

Exercise 4: Neural network/MLP applied to MNIST data using backpropagation to compute gradients.

Exercise 5: Regularized linear and polynomial regression with validation set and learning curves.

Exercise 6: Support vector machines (SVM) with linear and gaussian kernels. Grid search with predefined validation set to tune SVM hyperparameters. Spam detection using SVM plus some email preprocessing. I used some regular expressions borrowed from the internet to filter the emails and NTLK for stemming.

Exercise 7: Unsupervised learning techniques. K-means with application to image compression. Principal component analysis (PCA) via singular value decomposition (SVD) applied to facial image data.

Exercise 8: Anomaly detection with gaussian parameter estimation. Collaborative filtering for movie recommendations.
